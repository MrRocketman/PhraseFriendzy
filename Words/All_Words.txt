who cares
who died and left you in charge
who died and made you boss
who knows
who would have thought it
who'd have thunk it
whoops, there go my trousers
who's asking
who's calling
who's 'she', the cat's mother?
who's your daddy
why don't you pick on someone your own size
will you marry me
winner, winner, chicken dinner
wish you well
with a view to
with ages
with an eye to
with any luck
with friends like these who needs enemies
with friends like those who needs enemies
women and children first
wonders never cease
word has it
workers of the world, unite

you have the advantage of me
you kiss your mother with that mouth
you know what
you know what I mean
you know what they say
you learn something new every day
you must be new here
you never know
you said it
you shouldn't have
you think
you welcome
you win
you win some, you lose some
you wish
you'd complain if you were hung with a new rope
you'll be late for your own funeral
your good name
your guess is as good as mine
your mileage may vary
your place or mine
your wish is my command
you're fired
you're on
you're right
you're telling me
you're the doctor
you're welcome
yours truly
youth is wasted on the young
you've got to laugh

there but for the grace of God go I
there is an exception to every rule
there is nothing new under the sun
there is reason in the roasting of eggs
there may be snow on the rooftop but there is fire in the furnace
there's a sucker born every minute
there's always a bigger fish
there's many a slip twixt cup and lip
there's more than one way to skin a cat
there's no accounting for taste
there's no fool like an old fool
there's no I in team
there's no place like home
there's no point crying over spilt milk
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there's no time like the present
there's no use crying over spilt milk
they're only after one thing
third time's a charm
third time's the charm
this too shall pass
this too shall pass away
those who can't use their head must use their back
those who will not when they may, when they will they shall have nay
throw dirt enough, and some will stick
throw enough mud at the wall and some of it will stick
throw enough mud at the wall, some of it will stick
time and tide
time and tide wait for no man
time flies
time flies when you're having fun
time heals all wounds
time is money
timing is everything
to each his own
to err is human
to the victor go the spoils
to thine own self be true
tomorrow is another day
too many cooks spoil the broth
too much bed makes a dull head
treat them mean, keep them keen
truth will out
tune in, turn on, drop out
turnabout is fair play
two can play that game
two heads are better than one
two wrongs don't make a right
two wrongs make a right
two's company, three's a crowd
underpromise and overdeliver
use it or lose it
variety is the spice of life
walk softly and carry a big stick
walls have ears
wanton kittens make sober cats
waste not, want not
well begun is half done
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
what goes around comes around
what has been seen cannot be unseen
what you see is what you get
what's done is done
what's good for the goose is good for the gander
what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
when in Rome
when in Rome, do as the Romans do
when it rains, it pours
when one door closes, another door opens
when one door closes, another one opens
when one door closes, another opens
when one door shuts, another door opens
when one door shuts, another one opens
when one door shuts, another opens
when the cat's away
when the cat's away the mice will play
when the going gets tough, the tough get going
where there's muck there's brass
where there's smoke, there's fire
wherever you go, there you are
who pays the piper calls the tune
work smarter, not harder
wrap it before you tap it
you are what you eat
you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink
you can't fight city hall
you can't get a quart into a pint pot
you can't judge a book by its cover
you can't make a silk purse of a sow's ear
you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
you can't polish a turd
you can't put a wise head on young shoulders
you can't put an old head on young shoulders
you can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
you can't take it with you
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't tell a book by its cover
you can't unring a bell
you don't dip your pen in company ink
you don't dip your pen in the company's ink
you don't dip your pen in the inkwell
you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
you get more with a kind word and a gun than you do with a kind word alone
you get what you pay for
you make the bed you lie in
you never know what you've got till it's gone
you only get what you give
you pays your money and you takes your choice
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you snooze you lose
you've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelette
you're never too old to learn
you've got to be in it to win it
