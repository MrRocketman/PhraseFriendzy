Elvis lives
dormitory dirty room
the eyes they see
I spared a spider
car has a crash
fingertips finest grip
television ads enslave idiots
disc is cd
A diet I'd eat
young lad an old guy
asteroid threats disaster to earth
meal for one for me alone
my ideal time Immediately
I think therefore I am I fear to think I'm here
a gentleman elegant man
rats and mice in cat's dream
a perfectionist I often practice
orators hate a sore throat
coins kept in pockets
astronomer moon starer
astronomers no more stars
action man cannot aim
school student tends to slouch
debit card bad credit
certainly not can't rely on it
schoolmaster the classroom
clothes pins so let's pinch
garbage man bag manager
postmaster stamp store
heavy rain hire a navy
a decimal point I'm a dot in place
the Morse code Here come dots
eleven plus two twelve plus one
statue of liberty built to stay free
conversation voices rant on
video game give a demo
drum solo so loud Mr.
timetable Bet I'm late
sweep the floor too few helpers
older and wiser I learned words
anti-democratic dictator came in
intensive care I can't even rise
